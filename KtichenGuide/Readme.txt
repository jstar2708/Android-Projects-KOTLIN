Hello readers,
My app name is HomeMade and is used to search recipes.This app uses an API called spoontacluar
API and it can perform 150 requests per day.
It is currently using the free developer version of the API.The main activity of the app displays
some of the random recipes first, from from API. The user can search his own recipe of his/her
own choice using the search bar.On clicking on any one of the recipe a new activity is displayed
called the recipeData activity and this activity consists of a Tab layout with three fragments attached
to it.These fragments are meal card, recipe info and nutrients.

Meal card fragments displays a brief summary of the recipe and also shows an image of the recipe card.

Recipe Info displays some of the details of a recipe and also shows the ingredients required for making recipe.
It also contains a button which can be used to browse to the actual recipe site

At last the nutrients fragment which displays a brief information about the nutrients  in the recipe.
